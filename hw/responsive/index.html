          <br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp In the central region of Abalathia’s
          Spine, that great mountain range that spans
          Aldenard from east to west, can be found the
          forbidding highlands of Coerthas and the Holy
          See of Ishgard. The archbishop of the church,
          while leading his people in the teachings of
          Halone, the Fury, rules also as the nation’s
          sovereign.

          wages constant battle against its mortal
          enemies, the dragons. Faced with ever more
          aggressive att-acks from its serpentine foes, as
          well as an unp-recedented spell of bitter cold,
          the theocracy’s days are dark indeed.

        <div>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIshgard is a strict theocracy
          led by the line of Thordan I, its
          current leader being Archbishop
          Thordan VII and his Heavens Ward.
          The Orthodox Church employs
          inquisitors to root out heresy among
          its populace (often with fatal results
          for the accused regardless of guilt or
          innocence). The chur-ch has a knightly
          order, the Temple Knights, led by
          Lord Commander Aymeric de Borel.

        <br>
        <div>
          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Most of the power in Ishgard
          is concentrated in the nobility.
          Almost universally staunch traditionalists,
          they are reluctant to
          trust outsiders, or even the other
          city-states of the Eorzean Alliance.
          Within the city-state, the “lowborn”
          commonfolk are often viewed as
          little better than disposable serva-nts
          by the “highborn” nobles and the
          church. The nobility is divided into
          four “High Houses”, each descended
          from four of the Twelve Knights of
          le-gend. Each high house, led by a
          Count, is composed of lords and a
          knightly order, and the city-state’s
          flag depicts the symbol of each house.

            Of all the things that are symbolic of
            the nation of Ishgard, few are more
            recognized than the dragoon. Born
            amidst the timeless conflict between
            men and dragons, these lance-wielding
            knights have developed an aerial
            style of combat, that they might better
            pierce the scaled hides of their
            mortal foes.
            <br><br>
            Taking to the firmament as though
            it were an extension of the land,
            they descend upon the enemy with
            every ounce of their bodies behind
            the blow. It is this penetrative power
            that characterizes the dragoon.
