        <div>&nbsp&nbspIshgard is a strict theocracy
          led by the line of Thordan I, its
          current leader being Archbishop
          Thordan VII and his Heavens Ward.
          The Orthodox Church employs inquisitors to root out heresy among
          its populace (often with fatal results
          for the accused regardless of guilt or
          innocence). The church has a knightly
          order, the Temple Knights, led by
          Lord Commander Aymeric de Borel.
          Most of the power in Ishgard
          is concentrated in the nobility.
          Almost universally staunch traditionalists,
          they are reluctant to
          trust outsiders, or even the other
          city-states of the Eorzean Alliance.

          Within the city-state, the “lowborn”
          commonfolk are often viewed as
          little better than disposable servants
          by the “highborn” nobles and the
          church. The nobility is divided into
          four “High Houses”, each descended
          from four of the Twelve Knights of
          legend. Each high house, led by a
          Count, is composed of lords and a
          knightly order, and the city-state’s
          flag depicts the symbol of each house</div>
