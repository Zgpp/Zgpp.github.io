          <br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp In the central region of Abalathia’s
          Spine, that great mountain range that spans
          Aldenard from east to west, can be found the
          forbidding highlands of Coerthas and the Holy
          See of Ishgard. The archbishop of the church,
          while leading his people in the teachings of
          Halone, the Fury, rules also as the nation’s
          sovereign.

          <br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Ishgard’s formidable army of knights
          wages constant battle against its mortal
          enemies, the dragons. Faced with ever more
          aggressive att-acks from its serpentine foes, as
          well as an unp-recedented spell of bitter cold,
          the theocracy’s days are dark indeed.

      <article class="">
        <div>Ishgard is a strict theocracy
            led by the line of Thordan I, its
            current leader being Archbishop
            Thordan VII and his Heavens Ward.
            The Orthodox Church employs
            inquisitors to root out heresy among
            its populace (often with fatal results
            for the accused regardless of guilt or
            innocence). The church has a knightly
            order, the Temple Knights, led by
            Lord Commander Aymeric de Borel.

        </div>
        <div>
            Most of the power in Ishgard
            is concentrated in the nobility.
            Almost universally staunch traditionalists,
            they are reluctant to
            trust outsiders, or even the other
            city-states of the Eorzean Alliance.
            Within the city-state, the “lowborn”
            commonfolk are often viewed as
            little better than disposable servants
            by the “highborn” nobles and the
            church. The nobility is divided into
            four “High Houses”, each descended
            from four of the Twelve Knights of
            legend. Each high house, led by a
            Count, is composed of lords and a
            knightly order, and the city-state’s
            flag depicts the symbol of each house.
